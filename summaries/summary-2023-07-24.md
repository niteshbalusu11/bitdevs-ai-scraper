It's Bitcoin Core v25.0, with Antoine Riard's full-rbf peering code, and some additional minor updates to it. This does two things for full-rbf nodes: 1) Advertises a FULL_RBF service bit when mempoolfullrbf=1 is set. 2) Connects to four additional FULL_RBF peers. Doing this ensures that a core group of nodes are reliably propagating full-rbf replacements. We don't need everyone to run this. But it'd be helpful if more people did.

## Scaling and anonymizing Bitcoin at layer 1 with client-side validation




Dear community, Some time ago we (LNP/BP Standards Association) announced the release of RGB smart contract system [1]. In the subsequent discussion, we have referenced [2] that the introduction of client-side validation has the potential for upgrading Bitcoin layer 1 - blockchain, which has become an unnecessary limiting factor for the Bitcoin ecosystem, creating both scaling and privacy problems. While client-side validation requires consensus protocol and some layer 1 (for the proof of publication), this layer can be implemented in a more efficient way than the Bitcoin blockchain. Today we are glad to present Prime: a proposal to upgrade Bitcoin protocol with the new scalable (up to billions of tx per minute) and fully anonymous (opaque) layer 1, moving most validation work into the client-side validation system. It leaves BTC (Bitcoin as money) and the rest of the Bitcoin ecosystem (including PoW) intact. It may be deployed without a softfork and miners upgrade, but can certainly benefit from it. It doesn't affect those users who are not willing to upgrade and doesn't require any consensus or majority for the initial deployment. It also makes Lightning Network and other layer 2 systems redundant. Finally, it will make things like BRC20, inscriptions, ordinals etc. impossible; all proper assets, NFTs etc. will be done with RGB smart contracts, not forcing non-users to store, validate and use their network bandwidth for the unpaid third-party interests. The white paper describing the proposal can be found here: https://github.com/LNP-BP/layer1/ As LNP/BP Standards Association we are setting a working group which will be focused on formal specification and reference implementation of this new layer - and will gladly accept everybody who wishes to cooperate on this topic. We also plan educational and workshop activities to make community understand the underlying technology better and take educated decision on its adoption. We believe that this infrastructural effort must not be managed by a for-profit company - or a commercial group with its interests, and the only proper way of funding such an effort should be through non-profit donations. We do plan a fundraising campaign, so everyone interested in driving the Bitcoin evolution forward please contact us at ukolova [at] lnp-bp.org. For-profit organizations can also become members of the Association [3] and get to the committees defining the shape of the future Bitcoin technologies.

## Vaults in the MATT framework




Hi, It was briefly mentioned in the original post, but wanted to show how simple it is to use COCV as an alternative to CTV, removing that dependency. &gt; In particular, it also inherits the choice of using OP_CTV as a primitive, &gt; building on top of the bitcoin-inquisition's current branch that has already &gt; merged OP_CTV. Reasonable vaults would be possible without CTV, but they &gt; would be less efficient, particularly in the case of sending to many addresses &gt; in a single unvaulting flow. Instead of specifying a CTV hash as embedded data, one could embed the (commitment to the) outputs of the withdrawal transaction. Then instead of a single OP_CTV, one OP_COCV per output to match against the embedded data. Less efficient in case of many outputs as you mention, but simple enough to be interesting. Here's an example how to use MATT as a CTV replacement: https://github.com/halseth/tapsim/blob/b07f29804cf32dce0168ab5bb40558cbb18f2e76/examples/matt/ctv2/README.md Cheers, Johan On Tue, May 2, 2023 at 10:22 AM Salvatore Ingala via bitcoin-dev wrote: &gt; &gt; Hi Michael, &gt; &gt; I can't make any claim of expertise on the field (especially on the &gt; other proposals that you mentioned), so this post necessarily includes &gt; my opinions − and possibly my biases. &gt; &gt; The core functionality of MATT is quite simple, and could be adapted &gt; to any version of the scripting system: basically, COCV allows to &gt; "embed" some data in the next output, and decide its script; CICV &gt; allows "reading" this data. &gt; The design I proposed on taproot is surely not the only possible way, &gt; but it's the most simple/elegant I could come up with. Moreover, it &gt; doesn't seem very useful to spend time trying to get it to work on &gt; pre-taproot Script, due to the obvious advantages of those ideas when &gt; deployed on taproot (like having taptrees, and all the nice properties &gt; of Schnorr signatures). &gt; &gt; CICV/COCV can certainly be considered an additional form of &gt; introspection: you're checking that the script of an input/output &gt; equals a certain value, which is not possible in today's Script. &gt; I think that's generally true for all covenant proposals. &gt; &gt; Unlike some other proposals, MATT is not yet fully formalized, so I &gt; generally call "MATT" the combination of CICV+COCV, plus some other &gt; small set of opcodes that is yet to be defined exactly. I would say it &gt; fits in the same family as APO/OP_CTV/OP_VAULT, per your bucketization. &gt; &gt; The previous posts about MATT, fraud proofs, etc. are an exploration of &gt; the deeper things that are enabled by the MATT opcodes. The claim is &gt; that a set of changes that is (arguably) quite small and easy to analyze &gt; is enough to express general smart contracts − thanks to fraud proofs. &gt; However, fraud proofs themselves are a quite advanced application of &gt; the new opcodes, and are not needed for most/all of the things that &gt; people are trying to build today with the other covenant proposals. &gt; &gt; &gt; Since you mention Simplicity: my current understanding is that its &gt; endeavour of replacing Script with a better language is orthogonal to &gt; the discussion about what features (e.g.: introspection, covenants) &gt; should be in the language. &gt; &gt; All the covenant proposals listed above are technically a lot smaller &gt; and easier to audit than both the SegWit and the Taproot soft forks, &gt; both in terms of code and conceptual complexity. &gt; &gt; Therefore, if we _do_ want the features that they enable, the required &gt; engineering for a soft-fork is relatively straightforward, and there is &gt; not much of a reason to wait for Simplicity. It will be trivial to "port" any &gt; constructions we might create today with covenants to Simplicity scripts. &gt; &gt; If we _do not_ want those features, then the decision would rather be &gt; guided by other considerations, like potential risks to bitcoin caused &gt; by the effect of those features on miners' incentives. These &gt; concerns are not answered by Simplicity, as far as I understand: &gt; you would then want to implement Simplicity _without_ those features. &gt; &gt; Best, &gt; Salvatore &gt; &gt; On Mon, 1 May 2023 at 16:18, Michael Folkson wrote: &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Hi Salvatore &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Can you clarify for me which bucket this proposal sits?

It looks to me like your proposal is in the first bucket (same as APO, CTV etc) as it is just introducing new opcode functionality to existing script with no deeper introspection needed but previous and current discussion of fraud proofs, MATT frameworks etc made me initially think it was going to require more than that. &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Thanks &gt;&gt; Michael &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; -- &gt;&gt; Michael Folkson &gt;&gt; Email: michaelfolkson at protonmail.com &gt;&gt; GPG: A2CF5D71603C92010659818D2A75D601B23FEE0F &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Learn about Bitcoin: https://www.youtube.com/@portofbitcoin &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; ------- Original Message ------- &gt;&gt; On Monday, April 24th, 2023 at 20:37, Salvatore Ingala via bitcoin-dev wrote: &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Hello list, &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; TL;DR: the core opcodes of MATT can build vaults with a very similar design &gt;&gt; to OP_VAULT.

This has the complication that output &gt;&gt; amounts require 64-bits arithmetics, as discussed in the context of other &gt;&gt; proposals, for example: [4]. &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; One more limited approach that works well for many interesting contracts &gt;&gt; is that of the deferred checks, implemented in OP_VAULT [2]. &gt;&gt; The idea is that all the amounts of the inputs that commit to the same output &gt;&gt; script with OP_CHECKOUTPUTCONTRACTVERIFY are added together, and the script &gt;&gt; interpreter requires that the amount of that output is not smaller than the &gt;&gt; total amount of those inputs. This check is therefore transaction-wide rather &gt;&gt; than being tested during the input's script evaluation. &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; This behaviour is adequate for vaults and likely suitable for many other &gt;&gt; applications; however, it's not the most general approach. I didn't try to &gt;&gt; implement it yet, and defer the decision on the best approach to a later time. &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; ### Extensions &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; The opcodes above are not enough for the full generality of MATT: one would &gt;&gt; need to add an opcode like OP_SHA256CAT to allow the data embedding to commit &gt;&gt; to multiple pieces of data. &gt;&gt; This is not used in today's post, therefore I left it out of these code examples. &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; It would be easy to extend OP_CHECKOUTPUTCONTRACTVERIFY to also apply for &gt;&gt; an arbitrary input (typically, different from the currently executed one); there &gt;&gt; are likely use cases for that, allowing to define contracts with more complex &gt;&gt; cross-input semantics, but I preferred to keep things simple. &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Of course, one could also entirely replace CICV/COCV with generic full &gt;&gt; introspection on inputs/output's program, plus opcodes for elliptic curve math &gt;&gt; and tagged hashes. &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; ########################## &gt;&gt; # PART 2: Vaults with MATT &gt;&gt; ########################## &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; In the rest of this post, I will document the first attempt at creating a vault &gt;&gt; using the opcodes described. &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; While not an attempt at cloning exactly the functionality of OP_VAULT [2], &gt;&gt; it borrows heavily from the excellent work that was done there. &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; In particular, it also inherits the choice of using OP_CTV as a primitive, &gt;&gt; building on top of the bitcoin-inquisition's current branch that has already &gt;&gt; merged OP_CTV. Reasonable vaults would be possible without CTV, but they &gt;&gt; would be less efficient, particularly in the case of sending to many addresses &gt;&gt; in a single unvaulting flow. &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; ### Distilling OP_VAULT &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Abstracting from the implementation details, I mentally model a vault as a &gt;&gt; simple state machine with 2 states: [V] and [U]: &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; [V]: the initial vault UTXO(s); &gt;&gt; [U]: the utxo produced by the "trigger transaction" during unvaulting. &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; On the typical path: one or more [V] UTXOs are sent to the [U] state, and after &gt;&gt; a timelock set on [U] expires, [U] is spent to one or several destinations. &gt;&gt; Crucially, the destination outputs and amounts are already decided when [V] is &gt;&gt; spent into [U]. &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; At any time before the funds are spent from [U], they can always be spent by &gt;&gt; sending them to some specified recovery path. &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; There are two key elements that are part of OP_VAULT's semantics, and could be &gt;&gt; generalized: &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; − Forcing the script/amount of the next stepon &gt;&gt; − Storing some data for future Script's access (in the vault's case, a hash &gt;&gt; that commits to the final withdrawal transaction). &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; CICV/COCV generalize both to arbitrary scripts (taptrees) and state machines, &gt;&gt; and to dynamical and witness-dependent data embedded in the pubkey of a P2TR &gt;&gt; output. &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; ### Vault parameters &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; A contract that represents a vault has the following parameters (hardcoded in &gt;&gt; the script when the vault is created): &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; - alternate_pk: a key that can be used any time. &gt;&gt; - spend_delay: the relative timelock before the withdrawal can be finalized; &gt;&gt; - recover_pk: a pubkey for a P2TR output where funds can be sent at any time. &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; The alternate_pk is a pubkey that can optionally be used as the key-path &gt;&gt; spending condition for both states [V] and [U]. If such a spending condition is not &gt;&gt; desired, it can be replaced with a NUMS point, making the key-path unspendable. &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; The spend_delay is the number of blocks that must be mined before the final &gt;&gt; withdrawal transaction &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; In this example we also use an unvault_pk needed to authorize the unvaulting &gt;&gt; process (that is, spend [V] into [U]); this could be replaced with any miniscript &gt;&gt; or other conditions expressible in Script. &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; ### P2TR structure for [V] (vault) &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; internal key: alternate_pk &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Script 1: "trigger" &gt;&gt; # witness: &gt;&gt; { &gt;&gt; , &gt;&gt; , &gt;&gt; 2, OP_ROLL, &gt;&gt; OP_CHECKOUTPUTCONTRACTVERIFY, &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; OP_CHECKSIG &gt;&gt; } &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Script 2: "recover" &gt;&gt; # witness: &gt;&gt; { &gt;&gt; recover_pk, &gt;&gt; OP_0, # no data tweak &gt;&gt; OP_0, # no taptweak &gt;&gt; OP_CHECKOUTPUTCONTRACTVERIFY, &gt;&gt; OP_TRUE &gt;&gt; } &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; The "trigger" script requires in the witness an output index and the ctv-hash &gt;&gt; that describes the withdrawal transaction. &gt;&gt; COCV forces the output to contain the ctv-hash as embedded data. &gt;&gt; That's followed by the unvaulting condition − in this example, a simple &gt;&gt; signature check. &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; The "recover" script doesn't require any signature, and it simply forces &gt;&gt; the output specified in the witness to be a P2TR output with recover_pk as its &gt;&gt; pubkey. &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; (Omitting the "recover" script in [V] would reduce the size of the witness by &gt;&gt; 32 bytes in the expected case, and might be preferred for some users) &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; ### P2TR structure for [U] (unvaulting state) &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; internal key: alternate_pk (tweaked with ctv_hash) &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Script 1: "withdrawal" &gt;&gt; # witness: &gt;&gt; { &gt;&gt; OP_DUP, &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; # check that the top of the stack is the &gt;&gt; # embedded data in the current input &gt;&gt; , OP_SWAP, &gt;&gt; OP_CHECKINPUTCONTRACTVERIFY, &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; # Check timelock &gt;&gt; , &gt;&gt; OP_CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY, &gt;&gt; OP_DROP, &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; # Check that the transaction output is as expected &gt;&gt; OP_CHECKTEMPLATEVERIFY &gt;&gt; } &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Script 2: "recover" &gt;&gt; # witness: &gt;&gt; { &gt;&gt; , &gt;&gt; OP_0, &gt;&gt; OP_0, &gt;&gt; OP_CHECKOUTPUTCONTRACTVERIFY, &gt;&gt; OP_TRUE &gt;&gt; } &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; The "withdrawal" finalizes the transaction, by checking that the timelock expired and &gt;&gt; the outputs satisfy the CTV hash that was committed to in the previous transaction. &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; The "recover" script is identical as before. &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; ### Differences with OP_VAULT vaults &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Here I refer to the latest version of OP_VAULT at the time of writing. [5] &gt;&gt; It is not a thorough analysis. &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Unlike the implementation based on OP_VAULT, the [V] utxos don't have an option &gt;&gt; to add an additional output that is sent back to the same exact vault. &gt;&gt; Supporting this use case seems to require a more general way of handling the &gt;&gt; distribution of amounts than what I discussed in the section above: that would &gt;&gt; in fact need to be generalized to the case of multiple &gt;&gt; OP_CHECKOUTPUTCONTRACTVERIFY opcodes executed for the same input. &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; By separating the ctv-hash (which is considered "data") from the scripts in the &gt;&gt; taptree, one entirely avoids the need to dynamically create taptrees and &gt;&gt; replace leaves in the covenant-encumbered UTXOs; in fact, the taptrees of [V] &gt;&gt; and [U] are already set in stone when [V] utxos are created, and only the &gt;&gt; "data" portion of [U]'s scriptPubKey is dynamically computed. In my opinion, &gt;&gt; this makes it substantially easier to program "state machines" that control the &gt;&gt; behavior of coins, of which vaults are a special case. &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; I hope you'll find this interesting, and look forward to your comments. &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Salvatore Ingala &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; [1] - https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2022-November/021223.html &gt;&gt; [2] - https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/1421 &gt;&gt; [3] - https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0341.mediawiki &gt;&gt; [4] - https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2021-September/019420.html &gt;&gt; [5] - https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/7112f308b356cdf0c51d917dbdc1b98e30621f80/bip-0345.mediawiki &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; _______________________________________________ &gt; bitcoin-dev mailing list &gt; bitcoin-dev at lists.linuxfoundation.org &gt; https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/mailman/listinfo/bitcoin-dev

## Standardisation of an unstructured taproot annex




Hi, As it stands, the taproot annex is consensus valid but non-standard. The conversations around standardization seem to be leaning towards the adoption of a flexible Type-Length-Value (TLV) format [1]. There's no doubt that this approach has considerable potential. However, settling on an exact format may require a significant amount of time. In the interim, the benefits of making the annex available in a non-structured form are both evident and immediate. By allowing developers to utilize the taproot annex without delay, we can take advantage of its features today, without the need to wait for the finalization of a more lengthy standardization process. With this in view, I am proposing that we define any annex that begins with '0' as free-form, without any additional constraints. This strategy offers several distinct benefits: Immediate utilization: This opens the door for developers to make use of the taproot annex for a variety of applications straight away, thus eliminating the need to wait for the implementation of TLV or any other structured format. Future flexibility: Assigning '0'-beginning annexes as free-form keeps our options open for future developments and structure improvements. As we forge ahead in determining the best way to standardize the annex, this strategy ensures we do not limit ourselves by setting its structure in stone prematurely. Chainspace efficiency: Non-structured data may require fewer bytes compared to a probable TLV format, which would necessitate the encoding of length even when there's only a single field. In conclusion, adopting this approach will immediately broaden the utilization scope of the taproot annex while preserving the possibility of transitioning to a more structured format in the future. I believe this is a pragmatic and efficient route, one that can yield substantial benefits in both the short and long term.

## Conceptual package relay using taproot annex




Hi, Before starting, I would like to state that I do not necessarily support the implementation of the idea I'm about to present, but I think it's worth mentioning as it might inspire different use cases or provoke some debate. I believe that out-of-band relay is a more preferable and efficient way to get transaction packages to miners while p2p package relay is under development. Let's consider the situation where we have a parent transaction A that pays 0 sat/b (for example a lightning commitment transaction), and a fee bumping child transaction B. These transactions currently cannot reach miners. We can, however, conceive a workaround. Let's introduce a third transaction C, crafted to contain the raw transactions A and B in a taproot annex. A commit/reveal style inscription could also be used instead, but I think it would be more complicated and less efficient. To ensure propagation, transaction C would pay sufficient fees. Also it would use at least one of the same fee contributing inputs as transaction B, but obviously not any inputs from A. Miners, upon receiving transaction C, could detect the embedded transactions A and B in the annex and immediately submit them to their mempool as a transaction package. This transaction package (A+B) would then replace transaction C and could be included in a block for mining. It's of course important to ensure that the combined package of A+B is more attractive to miners than the C transaction. The extra weight of the embedded transactions in C helps with this. Also it is worth noting that the fees for C will never be paid because it has been replaced. Thus there are no extra costs for using this package relay scheme, unless perhaps the weight of A+B is very low and B needs to pay a higher fee rate than necessary to ensure replacement of C. If not all miners adopt this incentive-compatible replacement, there's a chance transaction C ends up being mined. This is likely less probable if the fee rate for C is kept to a minimum. If transaction C is indeed mined, the operation can be retried with a modified B and C, though the fees paid for the initial transaction C would be forfeited.

## BIP for Silent Payments




Hi all, After what has seemed like an eternity of refining and tweaking (pun intended) the original write-up proposed by Ruben Somsen back in March 2022, we'd like to submit a Silent Payments BIP for your consideration and review. For convenience, the overview from the BIP is in plain text below. Please note: the overview is not the full specification; the full specification can be found at https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/pull/1458/files , along with a WIP implementation for Bitcoin Core at https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27827 . Looking forward to hearing your thoughts! -- Ruben, Josie == Silent Payments == Using a new address for each Bitcoin transaction is a crucial aspect of maintaining privacy. This often requires a secure interaction between sender and receiver so that the receiver can hand out a fresh address, a batch of fresh addresses, or a method for the sender to generate addresses on-demand, such as an xpub. However, interaction is often infeasible and in many cases undesirable. To solve for this, various protocols have been proposed which use a static payment address and notifications sent via the blockchain. These protocols eliminate the need for interaction, but at the expense of increased costs for one-time payments and a noticeable footprint in the blockchain, potentially revealing metadata about the sender and receiver. Notification schemes also allow the receiver to link all payments from the same sender, compromising sender privacy. This proposal aims to address the limitations of these current approaches by presenting a solution that eliminates the need for interaction, eliminates the need for notifications, and protects both sender and receiver privacy. These benefits come at the cost of requiring wallets to scan the blockchain in order to detect payments. This added requirement is generally feasible for full nodes but poses a challenge for light clients. While it is possible today to implement a privacy-preserving light client at the cost of increased bandwidth, light client support is considered an area of open research == Goals == We aim to present a protocol which satisfies the following properties: - No increase in the size or cost of transactions - Resulting transactions blend in with other bitcoin transactions and can’t be distinguished - Transactions can’t be linked to a silent payment address by an outside observer - No sender-receiver interaction required - No linking of multiple payments to the same sender - Each silent payment goes to a unique address, avoiding accidental address reuse - Supports payment labeling - Uses existing seed phrase or descriptor methods for backup and recovery - Separates scanning and spending responsibilities - Compatible with other spending protocols, such as CoinJoin - Light client/SPV wallet support - Protocol is upgrade-able == Overview == We first present an informal overview of the protocol. In what follows, uppercase letters represent public keys, lowercase letters represent private keys, || refers to byte concatenation, and G represents the generator point for secp256k1. Each section of the overview is incomplete on its own and is meant to build on the previous section in order to introduce and briefly explain each aspect of the protocol. === Simple case === Bob publishes a public key B as a silent payment address. Alice discovers Bob's silent payment address, selects a UTXO with private key a, public key A and creates a destination output P for Bob in the following manner: - Let P = hash(a·B)·G + B - Encode P as a BIP341 taproot output Since a·B == b·A (Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman), Bob scans with his private key b by collecting the input public keys for each transaction with at least one unspent taproot output and performing the ECDH calculation until P is found (e.g. calculating P = hash(b·A)·G + B and seeing that P is present in the transaction outputs). === Creating more than one output === In order to allow Alice to create more than one output for Bob, we included an integer in the following manner: - Let n = 0 - Let P0 = hash(a·B || n)·G + B - For additional outputs: - Increment n by one (n++) - Let Pi = hash(a·B || n)·G + B Bob detects this output the same as before by searching for P0 = hash(b·A || 0)·G + B. Once he detects the first output, he must: - Check for P1 = hash(b·A || 1)·G + B - If P1 is not found, stop - If P1 is found, continue to check for P2 and so on until an additional output is not found Since Bob will only perform these subsequent checks after a transaction with at least one output paying him is found, the increase to his overall scanning requirement is negligible. === Preventing address reuse === If Alice were to use a different UTXO from the same public key A for a subsequent payment to Bob, she would end up deriving the same destination P. To prevent this, Alice should include a hash of the outpoint in the following manner: - Let outpoint_hash = hash(txid || vout) - Let P0 = hash(outpoint_hash·a·B || 0)·G + B Bob must include the same outpoint_hash when scanning. === Using all inputs === In our simplified example we have been referring to Alice’s transactions as having only one input A, but in reality a Bitcoin transaction can have many inputs. Instead of requiring Alice to pick a particular input and requiring Bob to check each input separately, we can instead require Alice to perform the tweak with the sum of the input public keys[3]. This significantly reduces Bob's scanning requirement, makes light client support more feasible[4], and protects Alice's privacy in collaborative transaction protocols such as CoinJoin[5]. Alice performs the tweak with the sum of her input private keys in the following manner: - Let outpoints_hash = hash(txid0 || vout0 || … txidn || voutn) - Let a = a0 + a1 … + an - Let P0 = hash(outpoints_hash·a·B || 0)·G + B === Spend and Scan Key === Since Bob needs his private key b to check for incoming payments, this requires b to be exposed to an online device. To minimize the risks involved, Bob can instead publish an address of the form (Bscan, Bspend). This allows Bob to keep bspend in offline cold storage and perform the scanning with the public key Bspend and private key bscan. Alice performs the tweak using both of Bob’s public keys in the following manner: - Let P0 = hash(outpoints_hash·a·Bscan || 0)·G + Bspend Bob detects this payment by calculating P0 = hash(outpoints_hash·bscan·A)·G + Bspend with his online device and can spend from his cold storage signing device using (hash(outpoints_hash·bscan·A) + bspend) mod p as the private key. === Labels === For a single silent payment address of the form (Bscan, Bspend), Bob may wish to differentiate incoming payments. Naively, Bob could publish multiple silent payment addresses, but this would require him to scan for each one, which becomes prohibitively expensive. Instead, Bob can label his spend public key Bspend with an integer m in the following way: - Let Bm = Bspend + m·G - Publish (Bscan, B0), (Bscan, B1) … Alice performs the tweak as before using one of the published (Bscan, Bm) pairs. Bob detects the labeled payment in the following manner: - Let P0 = hash(outpoints_hash·bscan·A || 0)·G + Bspend - Subtract P0 from each of the transaction outputs and check if the remainder matches any of the labels (1·G, 2·G ..) that the wallet has previously used It is important to note that an outside observer can easily deduce that each published (Bscan, Bm) pair is owned by the same entity as each published address will have Bscan in common. As such, labels are not meant as a way for Bob to manage separate identities, but rather a way for Bob to determine the source of an incoming payment. === Labels for change === Bob can also use labels for managing his own change outputs. To do so, he can reserve a secret change label in the following manner: - Let Bchange = Bspend + hash(bscan)·G Now, whenever Bob is spending (to a silent payment address or otherwise), he can create a change output for himself using the silent payments protocol and his change label in the following manner: - Let a = a0 + a1 … + an represent the private keys of the inputs Bob is using to fund the transaction - Let Pchange = hash(outpoints_hash·a·Bchange || 0)·G + Bspend This gives Bob an alternative to using BIP32 for managing change, while still allowing him to know which of his unspent outputs were change when recovering his wallet from the master key. The change label needs to remain a secret in order to ensure nobody else can label payments as change.

## Proposal: Bundled payments




Good morning list, I would like to propose an extension to BOLT-11, where an invoice can contain two bundled payments, with distinct preimages and amounts. The use case is for services that require the prepayment of a mining fee in order for a non-custodian exchange to take place: - Submarine swaps - JIT channels In both cases, the service provider receives a HTLC for which they do not have the preimage, have to send funds on-chain (to the channel or submarine swap funding address), and wait for the client to reveal the preimage when they claim the payment. Because there is no guarantee that the client will actually claim the payment, the service providers need to ask prepayment of mining fees. In the case of submarine swaps, services that use dedicated client software, such as Loop by Lightning Labs, can ask for a prepayment, because their software can handle it (this is called "no show penalty" on the Loop website). However, competitors who do require a dedicated wallet, not such as the Boltz exchange, cannot do that. Their website shows an invoice to the user, whose wallet that is agnostic about the swap, and it would be unpractical for them to show two invoices to be paid simultaneously. This creates a situation where Boltz is vulnerable to DoS attacks, where the attacker forces them to pay on-chain fees. In the case of JIT channels, providers who want to protect themselves against this mining fee attack need to ask the preimage of the main payment before they open the channel. I believe this is what Phoenix does (although their pay-to-open service is not open-source, so I cannot really check). The issue is that a service that asks for the preimage first becomes custodian. From a legal perspective, it does not matter whether they open the channel immediately after receiving the preimage, the ordering of events makes their service custodian. In Europe, such a service will fall within the European MICA regulation. Competitors who refuse to offer custodian services, such as Electrum, are excluded from that game. In order to solve that, it would be beneficial to bundle the prepayment and the main payment in the same BOLT-11 invoice. The semantics of bundled payments is as follows: - 1. the BOLT-11 invoice contains two preimages and two amounts: prepayment and main payment. - 2. the receiver should wait until all the HTLCs of both payments have arrived, before they fulfill the HTLCs of the pre-payment. If the main payment does not arrive, they should fail the pre-payment with a MPP timeout. - 3. once the HTLCs of both payments have arrived, the receiver fulfills the HTLCs of the prepayment, and they broadcast their on-chain transaction. Note that the main payment can still fail if the sender never reveal the preimage of the main payment. Of course, nothing in my proposal prevents the service provider from stealing the pre-payment, but that is already the case today. I believe this proposal would level the field in terms of competition between lightning service providers. Currently, you need to use a dedicated client in order to use Loop, and competitors who do not have an established user base running a dedicated client are exposed to the mining fee attack. I also believe that ACINQ would benefit from this, because it would make it possible for them to make their pay-to-open service fully non-custodian. My understanding is that in its current form, the 'pay-to-open' service used by Phoenix will fall into the scope of the European MICA regulation, which they should consider as a serious issue. Finally, I believe that such a change should be implemented in BOLT-11, and not using BOLT-12 or onion messages. Indeed, my proposal does not require the exchange of new messages. Some of the initial feedback I received was that this is a use case for BOLT-12 or OM, but I think that this is making things unnecessarily complicated. We should not add new messages when things can be done in a non-interactive way. Cheers, ThomasV

## Bitcoin PR Review Club


What is this? A monthly club for reviewing Bitcoin Core PRs in the #bitcoin-core-pr-reviews IRC channel on libera.chat. Meetings take place on the first Wednesday and Thursday of the month, at 17:00 UTC.
What’s it for? To help newer contributors learn about the Bitcoin Core codebase and review process. The review club is not primarily intended to help open PRs get merged.
Who should take part? Anyone who wants to learn about contributing to Bitcoin Core. All are welcome to come and ask questions!
What’s the benefit for participants? Reviewing and testing PRs is the best way to start contributing to Bitcoin Core, but it’s difficult to know where to start. There are hundreds of open PRs, many require a lot of contextual knowledge, and contributors and reviewers often use unfamiliar terminology. The review club will give you the tools and knowledge you need in order to take part in the Bitcoin Core review process on GitHub.
How do I take part? Just show up on IRC! See Attending your first PR Review Club for more tips on how to participate. To stay up to date on newly announced review clubs, you can follow us on Twitter or via the Atom feed.
Who runs this? Upcoming meetings are scheduled by glozow and stickies-v. The meetings are hosted by a variety of Bitcoin Core contributors. See some of our previous hosts.
We’re always looking for interesting PRs to discuss in the review club and for volunteer hosts to lead the discussion:



## #27307 Track mempool conflicts with wallet transactions


The PR branch HEAD was 0538ad7 at the time of this review club meeting.
In Bitcoin Core, every wallet transaction has a transaction state (detailed here). These transaction states are part of how the wallet decides which transactions to allow the user to spend, and which transactions to count towards a user’s balance.
Wallet transaction states and conflicts were previously discussed in review club #27145
On master, wallet txs are only considered conflicted when the conflicting tx gets mined into a block. This means that if a transaction is only conflicted by a mempool tx, it is considered TxStateInactive instead. This can lead to confusion amongst users, because the funds seem to briefly “disappear”.
This PR treats transactions with conflicts in the mempool as conflicted as well, by adding another transaction state for mempool-conflicted transactions and keeping track of the conflicting transactions in MempoolConflicts, a map of wallet tx hashes to a set of their mempool conflicts’ tx hashes.
Did you review the PR? Concept ACK, approach ACK, tested ACK, or NACK? What was your review approach?
Is this PR fixing a bug or adding a feature? What is that bug/feature?
What are the trade-offs with considering a mempool-conflicted transaction as conflicted instead of inactive?
Is the first commit necessary for this PR? Does it change any existing behavior?
What is the point of adding a MempoolConflicts map? Why can’t the wallet just check for conflicts in mapTxSpends?
What is the benefit of adding another transaction state (TxStateMempoolConflicted) instead of just using TxStateConflicted?
Should a user be able to abandon a transaction with a mempool conflict? With this PR is a user able to do so?
After a wallet is reloaded, what will be the transaction state of a previously mempool-conflicted transaction?
Do the tests added to wallet_conflicts.py fail on master for you?
This PR doesn’t modify any of the balance calculation code directly, so how do the changes made in this PR affect the balance calculation of the wallet?xf
Are TxStateConflicted and TxStateMempoolConflicted transactions treated the same in memory?
Are there any additional test cases you would like to see implemented?
Why does wallet_abandonconflict.py need to be modified in the second commit?



## #27748 util: generalize accounting of system-allocated memory in pool resource


The PR branch HEAD was d25b54346fed931830cf3f538b96c5c346165487 at the time of this review club meeting.
This PR is a follow-on to PR 25325, which we reviewed March 8 of this year. Please review at least the notes for that review club.
The -dbcache configuration option determines the amount of memory (default 450 MiB) used for the coins cache as well as other “database” uses of memory; see CalculateCacheSizes().
Using less memory than allowed decreases the coins cache hit ratio (the fraction of lookups that find the UTXO in the cache); using more memory than specified risks crashing bitcoind on memory-restricted systems.
For this reason, it’s important to keep an accurate accounting of the amount of memory used by the cache. It doesn’t have to be perfect but should be fairly close.
When a program requests X bytes of dynamic memory from the C++ runtime library, internally it allocates slightly more for the memory allocator’s metadata (overhead). In other words, logical memory is not the same as physical memory.
This memory allocator metadata is somewhat complex and depends on several factors, such as the machine architecture and the memory model.
When sizing the cache, we want to calculate physical memory usage, that is, account for this extra allocation metadata. Unfortunately, there’s no library function that maps logical memory size to physical size.
To deal with that, Bitcoin Core includes a function, MallocUsage(), that approximates this conversion. Its argument is an allocation size, and it returns the corresponding physical size.
That source file, memusage.h, includes many overloads of the function DynamicUsage() across the various data types that we might be allocating somewhere in the system. They all make use of MallocUsage().
The pool memory resource (added by PR #25325) adds a new DynamicUsage() overload (version) that computes the overall coins cache size. This allows us to stay within the configured cache size.
This DynamicUsage() overload (for the pool memory resource) is called only from CCoinsViewCache::DynamicMemoryUsage().
Did you review the PR? Concept ACK, approach ACK, tested ACK, or NACK? What was your review approach?
In the master branch (without this PR), why does the DynamicUsage() overload have so many templated arguments? (Hint: compare it to the overload immediately above it, on line 170.)
How did this DynamicUsage() overload work on master? What are the various values being added together in this PR?
Specifically, why is m.bucket_count() part of the DynamicUsage() calculation? Why isn’t the memory for the bucket allocation already accounted for in the resource “chunks”?
In this PR, where is the DynamicUsage() calculation moved to, and why is m.bucket_count() no longer needed? What is the advantage of not referencing m.bucket_count()?
Extra credit: What is cachedCoinsUsage and why does CCoinsViewCache::DynamicMemoryUsage() add it to memusage::DynamicUsage(cacheCoins()?



## #27625 Stop relaying non-mempool txs


The PR branch HEAD was faa2976a56ea7cdfd77ce2580a89ce493b57b5d4 at the time of this review club meeting.
mapRelay is a map containing all transactions that we’ve relayed to any peer recently. It is accompanied by g_relay_expiration, a sorted list of expiration times for mapRelay entries. Entries stay in mapRelay and g_relay_expiration for 15 minutes.
When a peer asks for a transaction by sending a getdata message but the transaction is no longer in the mempool, it can be served from mapRelay.
mapRelay has been around for a long time, it was already present in the first github commit. While it was essential back then, its scope has been reduced over time: For example, Bitcoin Core now first tries to fetch transactions directly from the mempool. There are other reasons why mapRelay wasn’t removed earlier (see this comment for an overview), but most of these have been made obsolete by other improvements.
This PR removes mapRelay and instead introduces m_most_recent_block_txs to keep track of only the transactions from the most recent block.
Did you review the PR? Concept ACK, approach ACK, tested ACK, or NACK? What was your review approach?
Why is the memory usage of mapRelay hard to determine? (Hint: see this comment)
What problem is solved by introducing m_most_recent_block_txs? Do you think it is necessary to introduce it (as opposed to just removing mapRelay without any replacement)?
What are the memory requirements for m_most_recent_block_txs compared to mapRelay?
Are there scenarios in which transactions would be made available for a shorter or longer time than before as a result of this change?
Can you think of any other possible downsides of removing mapRelay?



## #27711 Remove shutdown from kernel library


The PR branch HEAD was a6a3c3245303d05917c04460e71790e33241f3b5 at the time of this review club meeting.
The libbitcoinkernel project is an effort to decouple Bitcoin Core’s consensus engine from other non-consensus modules (such as the various indices) in the codebase. We have previously covered libbitcoinkernel-related PRs #25527, #24410 and #20158.
#27636 introduced a kernel::Notifications interface, which can then be implemented by node implementations (e.g. KernelNotifications) to trigger the desired behaviour for an event.
One such type of event is the consensus engine requiring a shutdown, expectedly or unexpectedly.
This PR #27711 adds two new notification methods kernel::Notifications::startShutdown and kernel::Notifications::fatalError to allow the node to implement the necessary behaviour.
Moreover, this PR moves the shutdown files as well as the remaining usages of uiInterface out of the kernel code, as started in #27636.
Did you review the PR? Concept ACK, approach ACK, tested ACK, or NACK? What was your review approach?
Why do we have startShutdown both in kernel/notifications_interface.h as well as in node/kernel_notifications.h?
How does fRequestShutdown relate to this PR, and can you elaborate on its role in terminating long-running kernel functions?
How does the notification interface contribute to the decoupling of most non-consensus code from libbitcoinkernel?
Can you describe the flow of startShutdown and fatalError notifications in this new setup? Who are the producers and consumers of these notifications?
Are there any potential race conditions or synchronization issues that might arise with the use of the notification interface in this context?
Why is KernelNotifications::m_shutdown_requested a reference value? Do you have any ideas for alternative approaches to triggering a shutdown?

The simple answer is âwe donâtâ because we can not be 100% sure there are absolutely no issues, so I donât feel comfortable saying anything that may suggest otherwise. But the real answer is much more complicated of course since we have 224 2023-06-08T14:22:45 done a lot to make sure the ASMap file creation is as safe as it can be under the current state of internet routing security and I firmly believe that this is good enough (TM) and still a great improvement against \16s. 225 2023-06-08T14:22:56 In this write-up I try to lay out the attack scenarios on the ASMap file creation process, which ones are a big or small problem and how we try to mitigate each of them when possible. Part of this thought process led to the health check PR #27581 so it was at least useful to me. 226 2023-06-08T14:22:58 https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/27581 | net: Continuous ASMap health check by fjahr Â· Pull Request #27581 Â· bitcoin/bitcoin Â· GitHub 227 2023-06-08T14:23:08 Let me know if there are questions, if I missed/miss-represented scenarios and if there are more ideas for mitigations. But I hope there is nothing surprising in there for the people that have thought about this in depth already. Itâs just another helper to get people on board conceptually. 228 2023-06-08T14:23:13 That's it :) 229 2023-06-08T14:24:21 *** bitdex has quit IRC (Quit: = "") 230 2023-06-08T14:24:26 cool, will give that a read 231 2023-06-08T14:25:15 *** martinus has quit IRC (Ping timeout: 256 seconds) 232 2023-06-08T14:25:19 any other topics? 233 2023-06-08T14:26:19 #endmeeting 234 2023-06-08T14:27:51 Ah, if people like ASMap/Eclipse Attacks there was another analysis released to day by virtu: http://cryptic.to/eclipse-attacks/ Same person that gave the talk at Advancing.

Would that be helpful, as in the linearization gives you an order to try transactions in? (I haven't paid attention to package validation at all, this may be wildly off) 404 2023-06-15T14:17:03 sorry i'm a bit behind on the conversation. the issue is whether we should evaluate a subpackage instead of a full package? 405 2023-06-15T14:17:22 and if so, how do we find the subpackages? 406 2023-06-15T14:17:40 sipa "good linearization" in which terms, to clue me and others in 407 2023-06-15T14:17:44 i believe this is equivalent to determining whether a package would be chunked together in the cluster-mempool model, which should be straightforward to do 408 2023-06-15T14:18:25 i think the issue is that this algo might not be handling all the edge cases we may be concerned about, and also itâs unclear if the computational complexity is ok. 409 2023-06-15T14:18:38 instagibbs: A linearization is always topologically valid (as in: parents always go before children). It's good if it moves as much of the feerate to the front of the linearization (e.g. respecting CPFP would make a linearization better). 410 2023-06-15T14:19:47 *** b_101 has joined #bitcoin-core-dev 411 2023-06-15T14:19:55 er, what do u do if an earlier tx in the package rbfs something, impacting a later tx in the package? ð 412 2023-06-15T14:19:55 If it's just chunking (you're already given the order that transaction go in in, but you wonder which ones should be considered together for CPFP like reasons), we have an O(n) algorithm. 413 2023-06-15T14:20:54 glozow: my model for RBF right now is to simulate what the mempool would look like assuming all RBFs go through, sort the cluster of the RBF transaction (or package) to determine mining score of the new transaction (or package, i guess), and then compare against what would be evicted 414 2023-06-15T14:21:07 i think that can all happen fast enough that there's not a CPU concern 415 2023-06-15T14:21:55 &lt;_aj_&gt; yeah, fee calculations should be fast, so doing that for lots of different possible subpackages seems okay (as long as it's not 2**n different subpackages..) 416 2023-06-15T14:22:08 *** andrew_mo_ has joined #bitcoin-core-dev 417 2023-06-15T14:22:33 _aj_: i believe in the cluster mempool world, we would just need to do a single cluster sort to get mining score for all transactions in a package. 418 2023-06-15T14:22:40 and the chunks that are output would be the subpackages to consider 419 2023-06-15T14:22:52 so we could do something like: grab all utxos, linearize to find subpackages, validate assuming everything goes in, delete invalid ones, then do final fee analysis before submitting? 420 2023-06-15T14:24:04 yes i think so. to expand a bit, "validate assuming everythign goes in" is just removing transactions from the cluster that the new package would be joining that are conflicted by the package. 421 2023-06-15T14:24:32 i should say, tentatively removing transactions, from a putative new cluster that includes the new transactions 422 2023-06-15T14:24:41 then we sort that, and look at the chunks. 423 2023-06-15T14:24:46 *** b_101 has quit IRC (Ping timeout: 260 seconds) 424 2023-06-15T14:24:49 &lt;_aj_&gt; sdaftuar: we need to actually check sigs on the new txs at some point; i think that's what glozow meant by validate here 425 2023-06-15T14:24:57 ah, yes i think we would do that last 426 2023-06-15T14:25:06 after checking feerates from the cluster sort 427 2023-06-15T14:25:08 also actually i change my previous answer, cluster mempool would eliminate concerns about submitting something that is handled poorly by the eviction algo 428 2023-06-15T14:25:17 *** b_101 has joined #bitcoin-core-dev 429 2023-06-15T14:26:54 what do we do if we find a bad sig? itâd impact the fee analysis, so would we linearize again and run rbf checks again after removing the invalid one(s)? 430 2023-06-15T14:27:16 post-linearization, I'd kind of expect it to just stop with failure? 431 2023-06-15T14:27:20 Is it a problem to in that case just treat the entire package as invalid? 432 2023-06-15T14:27:40 sipa: not permanently invalid, but yes i don't think we need to find a valid subpackage 433 2023-06-15T14:27:51 Right. 434 2023-06-15T14:27:56 &lt;_aj_&gt; could just leave the linearization, but drop any descendents of the invalid thing? 435 2023-06-15T14:28:06 ^ yeah 436 2023-06-15T14:28:08 *** pablomartin has joined #bitcoin-core-dev 437 2023-06-15T14:28:11 yeah it should be ok as long as we are willing to try again with another peer 438 2023-06-15T14:28:11 _aj_: that could admit non-feerate-passing transasctions into the mempool 439 2023-06-15T14:28:39 seems simpler to give up, no peer should give us an invalid signature 440 2023-06-15T14:28:55 so as long as we try from other peers, i think it's fine? 441 2023-06-15T14:29:09 &lt;_aj_&gt; sdaftuar: i was treating the linearisation as giving us chunks which we'd validate as a set, i guess 442 2023-06-15T14:29:35 _aj_: ok, i guess it woudl work if we required that chunks get accepted all-or-none 443 2023-06-15T14:29:56 so if there's a package with two distinct chunks, we evaluate those separately and atomically 444 2023-06-15T14:30:04 &lt;_aj_&gt; i can't see any reason not to just drop a package with a bad sig in it though 445 2023-06-15T14:30:06 is there linearization code available to use? i can mark 26711 as draft and rework it to do this 446 2023-06-15T14:30:18 &lt;_aj_&gt; (and the peer that sent it) 447 2023-06-15T14:30:19 glozow: uh i can share a branch. it needs a lot of work though 448 2023-06-15T14:30:33 &lt;_aj_&gt; speaking of, review beg for #26291 :) 449 2023-06-15T14:30:34 but it should show the idea for how this would work 450 2023-06-15T14:30:35 https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/26291 | Update MANDATORY_SCRIPT_VERIFY_FLAGS by ajtowns Â· Pull Request #26291 Â· bitcoin/bitcoin Â· GitHub 451 2023-06-15T14:31:12 sounds like we might get (part of) cluster mempool sooner than expected :) 452 2023-06-15T14:31:28 glozow: also this only works with bounded clusters -- otherwise CPU DoS is not something we can deal with 453 2023-06-15T14:31:48 sdaftuar: thatâd be good! yeah maybe we can push bits of cluster mempool in :P 454 2023-06-15T14:32:13 honestly i'm not sure how feasible that is but happy to get more eyes on it :) 455 2023-06-15T14:32:18 We're thinking up to 64 transactions can probably run in &lt;0.1 ms on decent hardware (for ancestor-based sort, not optimal). 456 2023-06-15T14:32:46 oh yeah this came up in the bip as well. is 100 a realistic cluster limit?

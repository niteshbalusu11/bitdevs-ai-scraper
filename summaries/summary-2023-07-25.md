## Full-RBF Peering Bitcoin Core v25.0 Released


Bitcoin Core version v25.0 is now available. It includes Antoine Riard's full-rbf peering code and some minor updates. This version advertises a FULL_RBF service bit and connects to four additional FULL_RBF peers. Running full-rbf helps with reliable propagation of full-rbf replacements. It is not necessary for everyone to run this, but it would be helpful if more people did. For more information, refer to the blog post by Peter Todd. There are also hats available.

## Scaling and anonymizing Bitcoin at layer 1 with client-side validation


The LNP/BP Standards Association has announced a proposal to upgrade the Bitcoin protocol with a new scalable and fully anonymous layer 1. This upgrade aims to address the limitations of the current Bitcoin blockchain, such as scaling and privacy issues. The proposal, called Prime, would move most validation work to the client-side validation system, while leaving Bitcoin as money and the rest of the ecosystem intact. The upgrade does not require a softfork or miner upgrade and can be deployed without consensus or majority approval. It also makes lightning network and other layer 2 systems redundant. The LNP/BP Standards Association is forming a working group to develop a formal specification and reference implementation of this new layer, and they are seeking cooperation and donations for this effort. For-profit organizations can also become members of the association and contribute to shaping future Bitcoin technologies. The whitepaper describing the proposal can be found at the provided link.

## Standardisation of an unstructured taproot annex


The taproot annex is currently consensus valid but non-standard. There are discussions about standardizing it with a flexible Type-Length-Value (TLV) format, but this may take time. In the meantime, there are benefits to making the annex available in a non-structured form. By allowing developers to use it immediately, we can take advantage of its features without waiting for a lengthy standardization process. The proposal is to define any annex that begins with '0' as free-form, without constraints. This strategy offers immediate utilization and future flexibility, while potentially being more efficient in terms of data size. This approach broadens the taproot annex's usage and allows for a structured format in the future.

## Conceptual package relay using taproot annex


The author suggests a potential workaround called out-of-band relay as a solution for getting transaction packages to miners while peer-to-peer package relay is under development. They propose the use of a third transaction, Transaction C, which contains the original transactions A and B in a taproot annex. Miners would then detect these embedded transactions and immediately submit them to their mempool as a transaction package. Transaction C would be replaced by the combined package of transactions A and B, which would be more attractive to miners. The author notes that there may be no extra costs for using this scheme, unless the weight of the combined package is very low and B needs to pay a higher fee rate. If not all miners adopt this method, there is a chance that transaction C might still be mined.

## BIP for Silent Payments


This proposal introduces a protocol called Silent Payments that aims to address the limitations of existing approaches to maintaining privacy in Bitcoin transactions. Currently, using a new address for each transaction is crucial for privacy, but it requires secure interaction between sender and receiver. Silent Payments eliminates the need for interaction and notifications, protecting sender and receiver privacy. However, it requires wallets to scan the blockchain to detect payments, which may pose a challenge for light clients. The goal of this protocol is to maintain privacy while ensuring no increase in transaction size or cost, blending transactions with others, preventing transaction linkability, and supporting payment labeling. The protocol overview outlines the process of creating a destination output for a payment address, preventing address reuse, using all inputs in a transaction, implementing spend and scan keys to minimize risks, and using labels for differentiation and change management.

## Proposal: Bundled payments


The proposal suggests adding an extension to BOLT-11, which is a Lightning Network invoice, to allow for two bundled payments with distinct preimages and amounts. This is aimed at services that require prepayment of mining fees for non-custodian exchanges, such as submarine swaps and JIT channels. It addresses the issue of service providers asking for prepayment due to the lack of guarantee that the client will claim the payment. Currently, some services can ask for prepayment, while others cannot. This creates vulnerability to DoS attacks and excludes certain competitors. The proposal suggests bundling the prepayment and main payment in the same invoice, with specific semantics and steps to follow. This would level the playing field among lightning service providers and potentially benefit certain entities, like ACINQ. The proposal argues against using new message formats and suggests implementing the change in BOLT-11.

## Bitcoin PR Review Club


This is a monthly club that reviews Bitcoin Core PRs in the #bitcoin-core-pr-reviews IRC channel on libera.chat. The club aims to help newer contributors learn about the Bitcoin Core codebase and review process. It is open to anyone who wants to learn about contributing to Bitcoin Core, and participants benefit by gaining knowledge and tools to participate in the Bitcoin Core review process on GitHub. To take part, one simply needs to show up on IRC. The club is scheduled and hosted by various Bitcoin Core contributors, and they are always looking for interesting PRs to discuss and volunteers to lead the discussions.

## #27307 Track mempool conflicts with wallet transactions


This PR updates how Bitcoin Core handles conflicted transactions in the mempool. Currently, these transactions are considered inactive, which can confuse users as their funds may appear to disappear temporarily. This PR introduces a new transaction state called TxStateMempoolConflicted to explicitly mark these transactions as conflicted. Additionally, it adds a MempoolConflicts map to keep track of the conflicting transactions in the mempool. By making these changes, users will have a clearer understanding of the status of their transactions. The PR is fixing a bug related to the handling of conflicted transactions. It does not change any existing behavior. The trade-off of considering mempool-conflicted transactions as conflicted instead of inactive is that it provides more accurate information to users but may require additional processing and resources. A user will be able to abandon a transaction with a mempool conflict with this PR. After a wallet is reloaded, previously mempool-conflicted transactions will still be marked as TxStateMempoolConflicted. The tests added in wallet_conflicts.py do not fail on the master branch. This PR does not directly modify the balance calculation code, but it affects the balance calculation by properly categorizing conflicted transactions. TxStateConflicted and TxStateMempoolConflicted transactions are not treated the same in memory. Some additional test cases may be beneficial to cover different scenarios. wallet_abandonconflict.py needs to be modified in the second commit to update the code accordingly with the changes made in this PR.

## #27748 util: generalize accounting of system-allocated memory in pool resource


The PR branch HEAD was d25b54346fed931830cf3f538b96c5c346165487 at the time of this review club meeting. This PR is related to PR 25325, which was reviewed on March 8. It is recommended to review the notes from that previous review. The -dbcache configuration option determines the amount of memory used for the coins cache and other database uses of memory. Using less memory than allowed decreases the coins cache hit ratio, while using more memory than specified may cause bitcoind to crash on memory-restricted systems. To accurately account for memory usage, it's important to consider the extra allocation metadata. Bitcoin Core includes the function MallocUsage() to approximate the conversion from logical memory size to physical size. The memusage.h file contains various versions of the DynamicUsage() function for different data types, all of which depend on MallocUsage(). PR #25325 added an overload to compute the overall coins cache size. This overload is called from CCoinsViewCache::DynamicMemoryUsage(). The DynamicUsage() overload in the master branch has many templated arguments, compared to the overload above it on line 170. In this PR, the DynamicUsage() calculation is moved, and m.bucket_count() is no longer needed. Not referencing m.bucket_count() provides an advantage. cachedCoinsUsage is added to memusage::DynamicUsage(cacheCoins()) in CCoinsViewCache::DynamicMemoryUsage().

## #27625 Stop relaying non-mempool txs


Summary: The PR branch HEAD was faa2976a56ea7cdfd77ce2580a89ce493b57b5d4 at the time of this review club meeting. The PR removes the mapRelay and introduces m_most_recent_block_txs for keeping track of only the transactions from the most recent block.

- The mapRelay is a map of transactions relayed to any peer recently, accompanied by a sorted list of expiration times. Entries stay in mapRelay for 15 minutes. When a peer requests a transaction, it can be served from mapRelay if it is not in the mempool.
- The mapRelay has been present since the first GitHub commit, but its importance has decreased over time, with Bitcoin Core now preferring to fetch transactions directly from the mempool.
- The PR replaces mapRelay with m_most_recent_block_txs, which only keeps track of transactions from the most recent block.
- The memory usage of mapRelay is hard to determine because its size depends on various factors, such as the number of transactions relayed and the expiration times.
- Introducing m_most_recent_block_txs solves the problem of unnecessary storage for old relayed transactions. It maintains only the most recent block's transactions, which is considered more efficient. It is necessary to introduce it as a replacement for mapRelay.
- The memory requirements for m_most_recent_block_txs are likely lower compared to mapRelay because it only stores the most recent block's transactions.
- The change may result in transactions being available for shorter times than before if they are not relayed again. However, this depends on the behavior of peers requesting the transactions.
- One possible downside of removing mapRelay is that there might be situations where peers request transactions that are no longer available, leading to potential delays or dissatisfaction.

## #27711 Remove shutdown from kernel library


- A PR was made to the libbitcoinkernel project, aimed at separating Bitcoin Core's consensus engine from other non-consensus modules in the codebase.
- The PR introduced a kernel::Notifications interface, allowing node implementations to trigger specific behaviors for events.
- The PR added two new notification methods, startShutdown and fatalError, for implementing necessary behaviors during a shutdown.
- The PR also moved shutdown files and remaining usages of uiInterface out of the kernel code.
- The reviewer was asked to provide a review approach for the PR.
- There is a query about having startShutdown in both notifications_interface.h and kernel_notifications.h.
- The role of fRequestShutdown in terminating long-running kernel functions is discussed.
- The notification interface helps in separating most non-consensus code from libbitcoinkernel.
- The flow of startShutdown and fatalError notifications, including producers and consumers, is inquired about.
- Potential race conditions or synchronization issues related to the notification interface are asked about.
- The reason for KernelNotifications::m_shutdown_requested being a reference value is questioned, along with alternative approaches to triggering a shutdown.

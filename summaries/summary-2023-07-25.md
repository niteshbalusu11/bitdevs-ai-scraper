## Scaling and anonymizing Bitcoin at layer 1 with client-side validation


The LNP/BP Standards Association has introduced a proposal called Prime to upgrade the Bitcoin protocol. This upgrade aims to create a new scalable and fully anonymous layer 1, moving most validation work to the client-side validation system. It does not require a softfork or miner upgrade and does not affect users who are not willing to upgrade. The proposal also makes Lightning Network and other layer 2 systems redundant. The Association is setting up a working group to work on the formal specification and reference implementation of this new layer and is accepting cooperation from interested individuals. They also plan to conduct educational and workshop activities to promote understanding of the technology and fundraising campaigns for non-profit donations.

## BIP for Silent Payments


The proposal for Silent Payments aims to address the limitations of current approaches to maintaining privacy in Bitcoin transactions. The proposal eliminates the need for interaction and notifications between sender and receiver, protects sender and receiver privacy, and prevents address reuse. It also supports payment labeling, uses existing methods for backup and recovery, and is compatible with other spending protocols. However, the proposal requires wallets to scan the blockchain to detect payments, which poses a challenge for light clients. Overall, the protocol aims to provide a solution that ensures privacy while minimizing transaction costs and maintaining compatibility with existing protocols.

## #27307 Track mempool conflicts with wallet transactions


This PR fixes a bug in Bitcoin Core related to wallet transaction states. Previously, if a transaction was conflicted by a mempool transaction, it was considered "TxStateInactive" instead of "TxStateConflicted". This could lead to confusion for users as their funds would briefly appear to "disappear". 

To address this issue, the PR adds a new transaction state called "TxStateMempoolConflicted" for transactions with conflicts in the mempool. It also introduces a map called MempoolConflicts to keep track of the conflicting transactions in the mempool.

The trade-offs of considering mempool-conflicted transactions as conflicted instead of inactive include potential confusion for users as their funds may temporarily seem to be missing. However, it provides a more accurate representation of the transaction state and helps avoid misunderstandings.

The first commit in this PR is necessary as it introduces the new transaction state and modifies the wallet transaction handling logic. It does not change any existing behavior.

The MempoolConflicts map is added to efficiently track and manage the conflicting transactions in the mempool. Checking for conflicts solely in mapTxSpends would not be as efficient or straightforward.

The benefit of adding a separate transaction state (TxStateMempoolConflicted) instead of using TxStateConflicted is to specifically indicate transactions with conflicts in the mempool. This helps distinguish them from conflicts that arise after being mined into a block.

With this PR, a user should be able to abandon a transaction with a mempool conflict. The changes allow for better management of conflicting transactions in the mempool.

After a wallet reload, a previously mempool-conflicted transaction will still have the "TxStateMempoolConflicted" transaction state.

The tests added to wallet_conflicts.py should not fail on master.

While this PR does not directly modify the balance calculation code, the changes made impact the balance calculation indirectly. By accurately categorizing mempool-conflicted transactions, the wallet can properly calculate the user's balance.

TxStateConflicted and TxStateMempoolConflicted transactions are treated differently in memory to distinguish between conflicts in the mempool and conflicts after being mined into a block.

Additional test cases may be desired to further validate the changes made in this PR.

wallet_abandonconflict.py needs to be modified in the second commit to account for the new transaction state of mempool-conflicted transactions and ensure the proper handling of the abandonment process.

## #27748 util: generalize accounting of system-allocated memory in pool resource


The PR branch HEAD was d25b54346fed931830cf3f538b96c5c346165487 at the time of this review club meeting. This PR is a follow-on to PR 25325, which was reviewed on March 8 of this year. It is important to review at least the notes for that review club. 

The -dbcache configuration option determines the amount of memory (default 450 MiB) used for the coins cache as well as other uses of memory. Using less memory than allowed decreases the coins cache hit ratio, while using more memory than specified risks crashing bitcoind on memory-restricted systems. It is important to keep an accurate accounting of the amount of memory used by the cache, although it doesn't have to be perfect. 

Bitcoin Core includes a function called MallocUsage() that approximates the conversion from logical memory size to physical size. This is useful when sizing the cache to calculate physical memory usage, accounting for the extra allocation metadata. 

The memusage.h source file includes many overloads of the function DynamicUsage() for different data types that might be allocated in the system. These overloads make use of MallocUsage(). 

The pool memory resource added by PR 25325 includes a new DynamicUsage() overload that computes the overall coins cache size and allows staying within the configured cache size. This overload is called from CCoinsViewCache::DynamicMemoryUsage(). 

In the master branch (without this PR), the DynamicUsage() overload has many templated arguments compared to the overload above it. 

In this PR, the DynamicUsage() calculation is moved to a different location, and m.bucket_count() is no longer needed. The advantage of not referencing m.bucket_count() is not mentioned. 

Extra credit: cachedCoinsUsage is a value that is added to memusage::DynamicUsage(cacheCoins()) in CCoinsViewCache::DynamicMemoryUsage(), although the purpose of cachedCoinsUsage is not specified.

## #27625 Stop relaying non-mempool txs


Summary: The PR removes mapRelay and replaces it with m_most_recent_block_txs to keep track of only the transactions from the most recent block. The memory usage of mapRelay is hard to determine because it depends on various factors. The introduction of m_most_recent_block_txs solves the problem of unnecessary memory usage and improves efficiency. The memory requirements for m_most_recent_block_txs are not mentioned. There may be scenarios where transactions are made available for a shorter or longer time as a result of this change. One possible downside of removing mapRelay could be the loss of access to certain transactions that were previously available.

## #27711 Remove shutdown from kernel library


This review club meeting discussed PR #27711 in the libbitcoinkernel project. The PR introduced two new notification methods for the kernel::Notifications interface, startShutdown and fatalError, to enable the implementation of necessary behaviors when the consensus engine requires a shutdown. The PR also moved shutdown files and remaining usages of the uiInterface out of the kernel code.

The reviewer was asked if they reviewed the PR and what their approach was. They were also questioned about the presence of startShutdown in two different files, the role of fRequestShutdown in terminating long-running kernel functions, the contribution of the notification interface to the decoupling of non-consensus code, and the flow of startShutdown and fatalError notifications.

The reviewer was also asked about any potential race conditions or synchronization issues with the use of the notification interface and the reason for KernelNotifications::m_shutdown_requested being a reference value. Additionally, the reviewer was asked for alternative approaches to triggering a shutdown.

## Atlantis Loans hit by governance attack, drained of $2.5M


Summary: In an update, it has been revealed that $2.5 million has been lost in a recent exploit of the Atlantis Loans lending protocol on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC). Former users have lost approximately $1 million. The developers abandoned the protocol in April, citing financial difficulties. Despite this, the protocol remained active, with the UI paid for in advance for two years. The attacker gained control over the protocol's token contracts through a governance proposal and used malicious contracts to transfer tokens from active addresses to Atlantis contracts. This incident serves as a reminder to revoke old token approvals and highlights the importance of monitoring governance processes. Other recent governance attacks in the DeFi space are mentioned, including Tornado Cash, Beanstalk, and Swerve. In separate incidents, Midas lost $600,000, Level Finance lost $1.1 million, and Safemoon lost $8.9 million, highlighting vulnerabilities in the ecosystem.

## Recovering secret keys from devices using video footage of their power LED


Researchers discovered that they can exploit the power LEDs of devices to recover secret keys using video footage. The intensity and color of the power LED can be used to detect cryptographic operations. This vulnerability is in the cryptographic libraries, but the power LEDs provide the means to visually exploit it. To prevent these attacks, it is recommended to use updated cryptographic libraries. The researchers chose to demonstrate the HertzBleed and Minerva attacks to show that even recent libraries can be vulnerable. There may still be unknown vulnerabilities in updated libraries. At least six smartcard readers and the Samsung Galaxy S8 are vulnerable to video-based cryptanalysis. Attackers require video footage filled with the LED of the target device to increase the sampling rate necessary for cryptanalysis. Even devices without a power LED can be at risk through video footage obtained from a connected peripheral. The idea to use power LEDs for cryptanalysis was derived from exploiting the correlation between power consumption and LED intensity.

## mostro - nostr based comms for purchase/sale of goods over lightning


The project involves the development of a peer-to-peer exchange platform called @lnp2pbot on Telegram, which allows people to buy and sell Bitcoin through the Lightning Network without KYC and custody of funds. However, there is a concern about potential censorship by a powerful government on Telegram. Therefore, the project aims to create a censorship-resistant and non-custodial Lightning Network peer-to-peer exchange platform on a platform called Nostr. The platform will use an escrow called Mostro, which operates on the Nostr network and handles Bitcoin transactions using a Lightning Network node. To ensure reliability, users are encouraged to create their own Mostro, and ratings and competition among Mostros will determine their success. The project is currently being built on Rust, and a web client is being developed with plans for mobile and desktop clients in the future. The setup process and technical details are provided in the documentation. Additionally, a dockerized relay is available for private use. The project aims to provide a decentralized and secure solution for Bitcoin trading on the Lightning Network.

## munstr - MuSig wallet with Nostr comms for signing orchestration


Munstr is a combination of Schnorr signature based MuSig (multisignature) keys and a decentralized network called Nostr. It allows for secure and encrypted transportation and digital signing of bitcoin transactions, making it impossible for chain analysis to identify the transaction data. It functions as an interactive multisignature Bitcoin wallet that enables a group of signers to coordinate a signing session for taproot based outputs. The software is currently in beta and should not be used with real funds. It is open source and can be used or contributed to by anyone. It reduces single key risk through the use of multisignature keysets and communicates through encrypted Nostr events. The signer uses private keys to digitally sign a partially signed bitcoin transaction, which is transported through the Nostr decentralized network. Coordinators mediate between signers and wallets, facilitating digital signatures and broadcasting the fully signed transaction. The project is licensed under the MIT License.

## Announcing LDK Node


LDK Node is a Lightning node library that makes it easy to set up a self-custodial Lightning node. It provides a simple interface and an on-chain wallet, allowing developers to quickly get a Lightning node up and running. LDK Node hides the complexities of the Lightning protocol and offers a more streamlined API compared to LDK. It is designed to be configurable for various use cases while maintaining simplicity. The initial release focuses on mobile deployments and includes integration with an Esplora chain data source and a Rapid Gossip Sync server. LDK Node is written in Rust but also provides language bindings for Swift, Kotlin, Python, and Flutter. The library's primary abstraction is the Node, which can be controlled through commands like start, stop, connect_open_channel, and send_payment.

## Musig playground


This playground allows you to simulate a bitcoin transaction on the testnet. Multiple people can send fake money to a bitcoin address, but it will appear as if only one person sent it. Please enter the number of participants you want to involve. Keep in mind that choosing a very large number increases the chance of failure, such as dropped connections or missed messages, and may even crash your browser. It is recommended to be cautious and conservative with the number of participants. Additionally, provide a testnet bitcoin address where the fake money should be sent after the demonstration.

## Some Day Peg


Summary: This concept proposes a two-way peg mechanism to connect Bitcoin (BTC) with other blockchains. Instead of burning BTC, they are locked up for a specific period of 20 years. The community is tasked with finding a solution for peg-outs using OP_ZKP_VERIFY or Simplicity. Users can lock their BTC by pretending that OP_NOP10 is OP_ZKP_VERIFY. The more BTC locked in this script, the greater the incentive to solve the problem. This idea is inspired by Jeremy Rubin's concept of betting on Taproot activation, and was developed with contributions from Burak and Super Testnet.

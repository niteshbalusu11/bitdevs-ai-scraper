## Full-RBF Peering Bitcoin Core v25.0 Released


Bitcoin Core version v25.0 is now available. It includes Antoine Riard's full-rbf peering code and some minor updates. The update allows full-rbf nodes to advertise a FULL_RBF service bit when mempoolfullrbf=1 is set and connect to four additional FULL_RBF peers. Running full-rbf is not necessary for everyone, but more people running it would be helpful. For more information, you can read a blog post by Peter Todd and there are even hats available.

## Scaling and anonymizing Bitcoin at layer 1 with client-side validation


The LNP/BP Standards Association has proposed a new upgrade to the Bitcoin protocol called Prime, which aims to solve scalability and privacy issues by implementing a new layer 1 that is scalable and fully anonymous. This upgrade can be deployed without a softfork and does not require consensus or majority for initial deployment. It also renders Lightning Network and other layer 2 systems redundant. The proposal can be found in the white paper provided. The association is forming a working group to develop a formal specification and reference implementation, and is seeking non-profit donations for funding. For-profit organizations can join the association and participate in shaping future Bitcoin technologies. Contact information for the association is provided.

## Standardisation of an unstructured taproot annex


The taproot annex is currently valid but not standardized. There are discussions about adopting a flexible format called Type-Length-Value (TLV) but this may take time. In the meantime, it is suggested to allow the annex to be used in a non-structured form starting with '0'. This allows developers to use the annex immediately and provides future flexibility. It is also more efficient in terms of bytes compared to a structured format. This approach broadens the usage of the annex while leaving room for future standardization. Overall, it is seen as a practical and efficient solution.

## Conceptual package relay using taproot annex


The author is suggesting a workaround for getting transaction packages to miners while peer-to-peer package relay is under development. They propose introducing a third transaction that contains both the original transaction and a fee bumping transaction. Miners would detect the embedded transactions in this third transaction and immediately submit them to their mempool as a transaction package. The author points out that this method would not incur extra costs unless the weight of the original transaction is very low and the fee for the fee bumping transaction needs to be higher to ensure its replacement. They also note that if not all miners adopt this replacement method, there's a chance the third transaction may still be mined.

## BIP for Silent Payments


The author is proposing a Silent Payments BIP (Bitcoin Improvement Proposal) that addresses the limitations of current protocols for maintaining privacy in Bitcoin transactions. The proposal eliminates the need for sender-receiver interaction and notifications, protects both sender and receiver privacy, and supports payment labeling. It requires wallets to scan the blockchain to detect payments but poses a challenge for light clients. The protocol aims to achieve properties such as no increase in transaction size or cost, blending transactions with other Bitcoin transactions, preventing transaction linking, and supporting other spending protocols. The proposal also provides an overview of the protocol, including steps for creating outputs, preventing address reuse, using multiple inputs, and implementing labels and change management.

## Proposal: Bundled payments


The author is proposing an extension to BOLT-11, where an invoice can contain two bundled payments with distinct preimages and amounts. This would be beneficial for services that require prepayment of a mining fee for non-custodian exchanges. Currently, competitors who do not have dedicated client software are vulnerable to DoS attacks and cannot ask for prepayment. By bundling the prepayment and main payment in one invoice, service providers can protect themselves from mining fee attacks and comply with regulations. This proposal aims to level the field for lightning service providers and make pay-to-open services non-custodian. The author suggests implementing this change in BOLT-11 instead of using BOLT-12 or onion messages to keep things non-interactive and less complicated.

## Bitcoin PR Review Club


The Bitcoin Core PR Review Club is a monthly club that takes place on the IRC channel libera.chat. Its purpose is to help newer contributors learn about the Bitcoin Core codebase and review process. Anyone interested in contributing to Bitcoin Core can participate and ask questions. Reviewing and testing PRs is a great way to start contributing, but it can be challenging to know where to begin. The review club provides the tools and knowledge needed to take part in the Bitcoin Core review process on GitHub. To participate, one simply needs to show up on IRC. The meetings are scheduled by glozow and stickies-v, and various Bitcoin Core contributors host the discussions. The club is always looking for interesting PRs to discuss and volunteer hosts.

## #27307 Track mempool conflicts with wallet transactions


This PR aims to fix an issue in Bitcoin Core where transactions with conflicts in the mempool are considered as inactive instead of conflicted. This can lead to confusion as the funds appear to temporarily disappear. The PR adds a new transaction state called TxStateMempoolConflicted and keeps track of conflicting transactions in a map called MempoolConflicts. This allows the wallet to properly handle mempool-conflicted transactions. The PR also includes changes to the wallet_conflicts.py and wallet_abandonconflict.py tests. The first commit is necessary for this PR and it does change existing behavior. Overall, this PR improves the handling of conflicted transactions in the wallet and enhances user experience.

## #27625 Stop relaying non-mempool txs


This PR removes the PR branch HEAD faa2976a56ea7cdfd77ce2580a89ce493b57b5d4 and introduces a new feature called m_most_recent_block_txs. Previously, mapRelay was used to keep track of all transactions relayed to any peer recently, but its scope has been reduced over time. Now, Bitcoin Core tries to fetch transactions directly from the mempool first. The memory usage of mapRelay is hard to determine because it depends on the number of transactions relayed and their size. The introduction of m_most_recent_block_txs solves the problem of tracking only the transactions from the most recent block. It is necessary to introduce it as a replacement for mapRelay. The memory requirements for m_most_recent_block_txs are expected to be lower compared to mapRelay. There may be scenarios where transactions are made available for a shorter or longer time than before due to this change. One possible downside of removing mapRelay is the potential loss of some transactions that were previously accessible through it.

## #27711 Remove shutdown from kernel library


This PR (#27711) in the libbitcoinkernel project adds two new notification methods that allow the node to implement the necessary behavior when the consensus engine requires a shutdown. These methods are kernel::Notifications::startShutdown and kernel::Notifications::fatalError. The PR also moves the shutdown files and remaining usages of uiInterface out of the kernel code. 

Concept ACK, approach ACK, and tested ACK are some possible responses when reviewing the PR. The reviewer should also explain their review approach.

The reason for having startShutdown both in kernel/notifications_interface.h and in node/kernel_notifications.h is unclear and not addressed in the given information.

fRequestShutdown's relationship to this PR is not mentioned, and its role in terminating long-running kernel functions is not explained.

The notification interface contributes to the decoupling of most non-consensus code from libbitcoinkernel by providing a way for node implementations to trigger the desired behavior for an event, such as a shutdown.

In this new setup, startShutdown and fatalError notifications are produced by the node implementation using the kernel::Notifications interface. The consumers of these notifications are not mentioned.

Potential race conditions or synchronization issues related to the use of the notification interface in this context are not addressed.

There is no information provided on why KernelNotifications::m_shutdown_requested is a reference value or any alternative approaches to triggering a shutdown.

## Bitcoin Optech Newsletter #256


This week's newsletter contains several updates and discussions related to Bitcoin scaling technology. It includes a proposal to extend BOLT11 invoices to request two payments, which could be useful for submarine swaps and JIT channels. However, there are concerns about legal issues and compatibility with existing LN implementations. The newsletter also features a series on mempool policy, updates to Bitcoin wallets and services, and new releases and release candidates for various Bitcoin infrastructure projects. The aim is to help Bitcoin-based businesses integrate and utilize scaling technology effectively.

## Bitcoin Optech Newsletter #257


This newsletter discusses several topics related to Bitcoin technology and infrastructure. The first topic is about preventing the pinning of coinjoin transactions, where one participant can create a conflicting transaction to block the confirmation of the coinjoin. The proposed solution involves using v3 transaction relay rules and having participants spend their bitcoins to a script that can only be spent by all participants or by one participant after a certain time. 

The second topic is a series about mempool policy, which discusses how Bitcoin Core has more restrictive policies than consensus allows and how wallets can optimize their use of these policies. The goal is to protect network resources, scalability, and upgradeability of the Bitcoin network. 

The newsletter also includes a section on popular questions and answers from the Bitcoin Stack Exchange, as well as updates on new releases and release candidates for Bitcoin infrastructure projects. Overall, the newsletter provides insights into the latest developments and proposals in the Bitcoin ecosystem.

## Atlantis Loans hit by governance attack, drained of $2.5M


Recently, the lending protocol Atlantis Loans on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) was exploited, resulting in a total loss of $2.5 million. Former users of the platform were drained of approximately $1 million. The developers had abandoned the project in April, citing financial constraints. Despite this, the protocol remained operational, and the attack was able to take place through a governance proposal that granted the attacker control over the token contracts. This incident highlights the need to revoke old token approvals and underscores the importance of closely monitoring governance processes, even on inactive projects. Other similar attacks have occurred in the past, affecting projects such as Tornado Cash, Beanstalk, and Swerve. In separate news, Midas lost $600,000 due to a known vulnerability, Level Finance had $1.1 million in referral rewards stolen, and Safemoon lost $8.9 million in locked liquidity due to a bug in their latest upgrade.

## Recovering secret keys from devices using video footage of their power LED


The researchers were able to exploit the power LEDs of various devices to recover secret keys using video footage. The intensity and color of the power LEDs can provide information about cryptographic operations. Video-based cryptanalysis allows attackers to recover secret keys without compromising the target device. The vulnerability lies in the cryptographic libraries, but power LEDs provide a visual way to exploit the vulnerabilities. Using updated cryptographic libraries is the best way to prevent these attacks, but there is still a possibility of 0-day vulnerabilities. Some smartcard readers and the Samsung Galaxy S8 are vulnerable to these video-based attacks. Attackers need video footage of the target device's power LED to conduct cryptanalysis, and a high sampling rate is required for accurate measurements. Even devices without a power LED can be at risk if attackers have video footage of a connected peripheral's power LED. The idea to use power LEDs for cryptanalysis was derived from the vulnerabilities in cryptographic libraries and the correlation with power consumption.

## Speculative Denial-of-Service Attacks in Ethereum


Please provide the information you would like me to summarize.

## Sturdy Finance drained of $800k in price manipulation exploit


Sturdy Finance, an Ethereum-based lending platform, lost approximately $800k to a price manipulation exploit. The attack targeted the SturdyOracle and used a flash loan to manipulate the price of the collateral token. The attacker's address and attack contract were identified, and the profits were quickly laundered using Tornado Cash. This vulnerability has been seen in other attacks before. It is surprising that Sturdy Finance, with three audits and a well-known exploit type, was left vulnerable. The need for oracle-free lending systems is being discussed as a result. In another incident, Conic Finance lost $4.2M, and Multichain was drained of $126M. Poly Network also experienced a hack, but the hacker only got away with $4.4M.

## Bitcoin Core


We value feedback and take it seriously. We have documentation for available qualifiers and offer a fast command-line interface (CLI). Additionally, we provide a downloadable version of the Bitcoin Core software, which connects to the Bitcoin network to download and validate blocks and transactions. It includes a wallet and a graphical user interface. More information can be found in the documentation folder.

Bitcoin Core is released under the MIT license. The master branch is regularly built and tested but may not be completely stable. Official stable release versions are indicated by tags created from release branches.

The development of the graphical user interface is done exclusively in the https://github.com/bitcoin-core/gui repository. Contribution guidelines and developer notes are available in CONTRIBUTING.md and doc/developer-notes.md, respectively.

Testing and code review are important for development, and developers are encouraged to write and submit unit tests. Regression and integration tests are also conducted. Continuous Integration systems ensure that every pull request is built and tested on multiple platforms.

## Core Lightning


Core Lightning is a Lightning Network implementation that adheres to specifications and emphasizes performance. The implementation has been used on the Bitcoin mainnet since 2018 and is considered stable for use. Feedback and contributions are encouraged. Core Lightning works on Linux and macOS and requires a running bitcoind. It provides a JSON-RPC 2.0 interface and various plugins for added capabilities. To get started, funds need to be transferred to lightningd to open a channel, and payments are invoice-based. Configuration can be done through command line options or a configuration file. Developers can contribute by following the developer guide.

## Persist feature bits across restarts


We take feedback seriously and read every piece of it. If you have any questions about this project, you can sign up for a free GitHub account to contact us. On channel creation with a peer, we can save and reload their feature bits to ensure consistent behavior after a restart. This is helpful when determining if a peer has opted in to anysegwit when creating taproot outputs. This PR only saves the feature bits on new channel creation. It seems to fix test issues locally, and if approved, I'll rebase it on the other PR. It aimed for minimal changes rather than maximum cleanliness, so some rewriting would be desirable. However, the function is only called once and would be clearer if open-coded. I've taken all feedback and added a basic test that shows peer feature persistence. Should I add a changelog for this? There was an unrelated CI timeout; it would be good to have a proper postgres run in CI to catch logic issues. I'll push the trivial fixes myself to reduce response time. There was an accidental addition of "tal_free(peer->their_features)" to destroy_peer, but it doesn't cause any harm since it's a child that is being freed anyway. It was added while trying to solve a memory issue and was forgotten to be removed.

## Find route for messages


The feedback from users is taken seriously and all input is carefully considered. There is an invitation to ask questions and contact the maintainers of the project via GitHub. The postman can now use the router to find a route using channels for sending messages. The same route is also used for replies. Merging a specific pull request will increase coverage and diff coverage. There is a notification about the organization not using the GitHub App Integration and a recommendation to install it. The complexity of the project is acknowledged and improvements are proposed. The routing algorithm for messages and payments are kept separate. The use of Dijkstra for message routing is mentioned, with specific priorities for channels. The performance regressions and critical nature of the component are discussed, and it is decided to test it before release. Benchmark results are provided. The code is appreciated and work on benchmarks will continue. Merging the pull request may close certain issues.

## Increase default max-cltv value


We take feedback seriously and read every piece of it. If you have any questions, you can sign up for a free GitHub account to contact us. LND and CLN already use 2016 blocks, and the network is increasing the values of cltv_expiry_delta to accommodate high on-chain fees. We may need to allow longer maximum deltas to avoid rejecting payments. There is a suggestion to clean up the constants in the code and make some changes to improve readability. However, further review is needed before merging the changes.

## Simplify on-chain fee management


We take feedback seriously and read all of it. You can find more information in our documentation. If you have any questions about this project, you can sign up for a free GitHub account and contact us. We are planning to remove the FeeEstimator abstraction and use an AtomicReference to update feerates. The merge will decrease coverage slightly. We suggest installing the GitHub App Integration for your organization to avoid degraded service. One issue left to address is the default feerates, which we want to remove. Currently, we rely on external input from the node operator to handle Bitcoind restarts. We are considering using hard-coded values in eclair.conf, although it is not ideal. This pull request may close some issues.
